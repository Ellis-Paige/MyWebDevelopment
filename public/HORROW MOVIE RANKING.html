<hr />
<p>I've watched so many movies in my lifetime so far and this webpage is going to express 3 of my favourite movies within the horror genre. I'm also going to give a brief description of the storyline from my perspective, as well as a personal overview of my thoughts and feelings towards them.</p>
<h2> Horror:</h2>
<p>I have a profound love for the horror genre. I revel in the thrill of fear and the intricate psychological twists it can weave within the viewer. The genre's vast array of scares never fails to intrigue me, and I enjoy delving into the myriad ways in which it seeks to evoke terror. <br >
<br >
    For each movie, I'll be providing three types of ratings out of 5:
 <ol>
    <li>Gore: Assessing the gruesomeness of deaths depicted and the effectiveness of CGI/special effects.</li>
    <li>Head Fuck Scale: Evaluating the psychological depth and impact of the movie.</li>
   <li> Scare Rating: Gauging the intensity of fear induced, encompassing jump scares and overall atmosphere</li>
</p>
</ol>
<h3>Cabin in the Woods</h3>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NsIilFNNmkY?feature=shared">Follow link to see a trailer</a></p>
<p>Story line: Five American college students embark on a cabin getaway in a remote backwater town. Their peaceful retreat takes a horrifying turn when they unintentionally summon a family of undead hillbillies. Unbeknownst to them, this sinister sequence of events is orchestrated by covert scientists working for their nation. Their mission: to fulfill an ancient ritual aimed at averting the world's impending doom, threatened by demonic forces from the underworld.</p>
<p>My Overview: The film begins in classic horror fashion, with its title setting the eerie tone. However, what sets it apart is the scientific backdrop from another location, adding a modern dimension to the storyline. As the plot unfolds, it keeps viewers on edge with typical horror scares while also intriguing them with the mystery of its outcome. The film's ending, true to its genre, deviates from the traditional happy conclusion, leaving a lasting impact in its own unsettling way. </p>
<h4>Gore rating(3) <br /> Headfuck Rating(2)<br />  Scare Rating(2) </h4>
<p> Although the gore in this movie is really good on a CGI level there isn't a lot on it. However, an end scene definitely reachers a (4). The Headfuck in this movie is the fact that the government has a secret relationship with the underworld and is doing this to other humans because of the need to generate sacrifices. The scare aspects in this movie are good traditional jump scare with a bit of a (3) rating towards the end, as well as being a scary dinamic mix between supernatural and realistic.  </p>
<h3>The Saw collention</h3>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Jco6j_BmIQw?feature=shared">Follow link to see collection of trailers</a></p>
<p> Storyline: In these disturbing tales, a man fancies himself a judge of human life, taking justice into his own hands by kidnapping individuals he deems deserving of punishment or a harsh lesson. He subjects them to horrifying torture within elaborate and deadly puzzle machines, designed to create near-impossible means of escape. Each trap presents a grim and life-threatening challenge, ensuring that the victims face excruciating pain and imminent danger.</p>
<p> My Overview: The 'Saw' movie franchise is renowned for its high levels of gore, featuring extremely gruesome and cringe-worthy scenes that leave viewers on the edge of their seats. The psychological manipulation, or 'head fuckery,' is taken to new heights, providing a total thrill ride for those with the kind of imagination that can immerse them deeply into the characters' harrowing situations. It's a rollercoaster of suspense and terror that keeps audiences hooked from start to finish.</p>
<h4>Gore Rating(5) <br />  Headfuck Rating(4)<br />   Scare Rating(3) </h4>
<p>The abundance of gore in the movie is deeply unsettling, particularly because it involves the human body, adding a personal and visceral element to the horror. The psychological manipulation, or 'headfuckery,' is particularly messy in this film, as the serial killer repeatedly evades capture and continues to inflict terror on his victims. His erratic and psychotic reasons for judging people only add to the sense of unease and irrationality, heightening the horror of the story.</p>
<h3>NightMare on elm street collection</h3>

<p> Storyline:In the infamous Elm Street neighborhood, a decade before the events of the first movie, a man named Freddy Krueger met a gruesome fate at the hands of his vengeful neighbors, who accused him of being a child predator. However, Freddy's demise was not the end. Ten years later, he returns from beyond the grave, haunting the dreams of the teenagers whose parents were responsible for his death. With his newfound ability to kill them in their sleep, Freddy becomes a terrifying force to be reckoned with, seeking vengeance from beyond the grave.</p>
<p>My Overview: This classic horror movie remains one of my favorites, and even after multiple viewings, it still sends shivers down my spine. The supernatural element of dream haunting, with its sense of no escape, is undeniably terrifying, especially considering that we all need to sleep. Throughout the series, the victims' desperate attempts to stay awake add to the nail-biting tension, as we watch them struggle against an unstoppable force that invades their most vulnerable moments.</p>
<h4>Gore Rating(3) <br />  Headfuck Rating(3)<br />   Scare Rating(3) </h4>
<p>The gore in this movie is expertly executed through practical effects and makeup art, resulting in realistic and gruesome scenes that leave a lasting impression. The fear of something as natural as sleep adds a deeply unsettling element to the storyline, especially for those with active imaginations who may struggle to shake off the lingering unease after watching. The scare factor is classic, with well-placed jump scares that build upon the audience's fear, all woven into a gripping storyline that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.</p>
