      As an individual deeply immersed in the world of creativity, armed with a Master's degree in Art and Design, I am currently undertaking the journey of acquiring proficiency in web development. Upon the culmination of this educational pursuit, I envision myself adeptly weaving together my artistic sensibilities and newfound technical skills to curate visually captivating and highly functional websites for clientele. This website serves as a testament to my ongoing evolution and growth in the realm of web development, providing a glimpse into the progression of my learning journey and the development of my craft. <br />

I'm excited to share the progress of two websites I've been developing. Currently, they sport a basic HTML layout reminiscent of webpages from the 80s â€“ a nostalgic touch indeed! Although I have yet to explore CSS, the code responsible for enhancing website aesthetics, my journey into web development officially begins on February 13th. Anticipation builds as I prepare to embark on this learning adventure. With each passing day, I eagerly hone my skills, knowing that mastering CSS will soon breathe new life into these projects, transforming them into visually captivating and contemporary web destinations.<br />
